# Host-Resolver
A tool to cycle through IP ranges against specific DNS servers. 

## Use Case
Personally, this script was written to enumerate hostnames for a domain that was not routable through the default assigned DNS, and it was easier to write this for en-masse checking and hostname enumeration. This was also found to be useful with identifying specific hosts for scopes within penetration testing using the filter option.
